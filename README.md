This notebook will develop an artifical neural network to perform diagnosis prediction of OASIS-2 (https://www.oasis-brains.org/) based on neuroimaging and clincial data. The work was inspired by the work of Battineni et al. using Support Vector Machines for the same problem.

DISCLAIMER: Some code for building/compiling the model was adapted from Google Machine Learning Crash Course (https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)
